# PrestackFractureDetection-HDNN
Prestack Fracture Parameters Detection by Hybrid Deep Neural Network (HDNN) Model

Based on data-driven deep learning, a hybrid deep neural network was developed to perform prestack fracture detection. Capitalizing on the connections between seismic responses and fracture parameters, a suitable azimuth dataset was firstly generated through fracture effective medium modeling and anisotropic plane wave analyzing. Then a multi-input and multi-output hybrid deep neural network was constructed to simultaneously detect fracture density, dip and orientation.
